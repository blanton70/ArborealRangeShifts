# ArborealRangeShifts

In this analysis I look at five species of trees mainly found in the Pacific coastal ranges of the United States: the Mountain Dogwood (cornus nuttalli), the Whitebark Pine (pinus albicaulis) the Pacific Yew (taxus brevifolia), the Oregon Oak (quercus garryana), and the Incense Cedar (calocedus decurrens). I hypothesize that we may be able to observe temporal shifts in either elevation or latitude in accordance with the global rise of temperatures. The data cover observation from the 1890s until approx. 2010. In order to ascertain any shift I run linear regression on elevation and latitude over the timeframe of the observations. This analysis is conducted with python and some affiliated libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn, geopandas, statsmodels.
