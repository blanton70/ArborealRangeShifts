# ArborealRangeShifts

Multi-linear regression analysis looking at five species of trees mainly found in the Pacific coastal ranges of the United States: the Mountain Dogwood (cornus nuttalli), the Whitebark Pine (pinus albicaulis) the Pacific Yew (taxus brevifolia), the Oregon Oak (quercus garryana), and the Incense Cedar (calocedus decurrens).  The datasets originate with GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) and US Geological survey and required cleaning and extraction via API. The hypothesis is there will be observable temporal shifts in either elevation or latitude in accordance with the global rise of temperatures. The data cover observation from the 1890s until approx. 2010. In order to ascertain any shift linear regression is run on elevation and latitude over the timeframe of the observations. This analysis is conducted with python and the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn, geopandas, statsmodels.  Recommendations may include species-level considerations for forestry or conservation purposes as well as criteria for conducting further analyses.
